Todo List
- I need to use better css. I'm not a fan of the one the demo provides.
- I need to create a log in system at some point. So a user could have private todo lists.
- I need to put this up on a server and make it live to use for myself.
- It would be a good idea that I actually put these items in the todo list itself.
- Add a text box in bottom template and insert text command to clone this repository.
- I like the idea that this demo has tasks by users only but I would like to have a global todo list.
