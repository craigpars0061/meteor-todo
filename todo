The irony here is killing me:
- I need to use better css. I'm not a fan of the one the demo provides.
- I need to create a log in system at some point. So a user could have private todo lists.
- I need to put this up on a server and make it live to use for myself.
- It would be a good idea that I actually put these items in the todo list itself.
