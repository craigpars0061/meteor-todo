Todo App step 3.
I'm trying out the Atom Text editor for this:

Todo App step 4:
I really like the Atom text Editor I just wish it was more like Sublime when
it comes to editing php files.

Attaching events to templates
Seems very easy to attach an event to a button.
"In our case above, we are listening to the submit event on any element that
matches the CSS selector .new-task. When this event is triggered by the user
pressing enter inside the input field, our event handler function is called."

Todo App Step 5:
Checking off and deleting tasks
Adding another template. Seems this one represents one task.
I was getting angry on this task because I kept getting an error:
"Uncaught Error: There are multiple templates named 'task'. Each template needs a unique name."
The trick is to remove this from body.html
<template name="task">
  <li>{{text}}</li>
</template>
Another thing I found at this point:
modules-runtime.js?hash=939c79dâ€¦:95 Uncaught Error: Cannot find module './main.html'
This is very annoying, and I find it in main.js.
I've no idea why main.js can't import ./main.html anymore.
The only thing I can do to keep going is to remove the import statement.
